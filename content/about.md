I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer with over eight years of experience in software development. I currently work as a Freelancer, specialising in developing scalable and efficient software solutions for clients across various industries.

I previously worked at ActivEdge Technologies as backend team lead, where I used my experience in software development and database management skills to lead a team of backend engineers in developing world-class solutions.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computing Science from Griffith College, where I graduated with honours. I actively participated in coding challenges and research projects during my academic tenure, showcasing my passion for software development.

Sometimes I share my thoughts about trending issues in software development and other interesting topics on [X](https://x.com/JeliliO_).
